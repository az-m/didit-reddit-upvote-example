## Reflections

Added by az-m:

- Created modal to inform guest users they will need to log in to vote.
- Created user profile page to show user's posts and comments.
- Fixed broken aspects of dark mode and tweaked responsive styling.

I couldn't replicate the issues mentioned in Moodle with the post titles and repeat voting, so I could not fix.
